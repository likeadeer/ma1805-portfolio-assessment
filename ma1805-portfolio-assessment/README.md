Drawing:

I was inspired by that one art piece where the circle gets activated, to put in simply, every time you click. You know, the example on the Notion page. I wanted to show a deep moment where me and my ex were offered to share a cigarette with a homeless man; he told us his life story, and said that me and him should stay together, protect our love blah blah blah. I tried to make my ex, the brown haired one flicker to show that hes leaving from the feelings I have towards that memory, but it made his hair flicker, not to mention his hair's curly. At that point I just gave up as I was too tired tbh. 

Movement and Multiples:
Movement:
I realised halfway through that I combined them, as I was inspired by the randomly appearing texts, and the notion for Movement and the mouse draw on the Multiples notion page. I'm also tired. My aim for these two codes is to show ignorance of consumers, in a way. I recently went to the war museum with my sister in London, and was of course very affected by the Holocaust exhibition, specifically a passage that was written by one of the victims:
The entire ghetto is ablaze,
during the day the sun
is darkened by the smoke
and during the night
the sky is red from fire...
they burn one house after
the other and people crawl out
of their hiding places.
Edith Jacoby, April 1943, Warsaw ghetto

The red patterns represent fire, and the text that refer to different social media trends is to show how we still today as a society cover up the chaos of fire and minorities suffering. Histories repeating itself. Which led me into more specific type of imagery.

Multiples:
I used the same technique with the circle thing, that coincidentally looks like smoke, but instead it erases images of the Holocaust and the genocide in Gaza to show how the media and audience simply ignore and erase the realities of victims. I made it so at the end, there was the passage by Edith to show that no one's safe; even if you ignore others' suffering, it'll come back to you eventually, you could be the one writing to the world so that you're seen. The war museum really affected me.

Media:
Honestly, I was too tired and just wanted to have fun trying to make a little diva cat. I like it considering it's simple and quick.

Conclusion:
This project was really fun, and a good introduction to coding. I'm excited to see what else I can do, as so far I've already learned so much from a range of different sources, and I already feel so much more confident when it comes to coding!
